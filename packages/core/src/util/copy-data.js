/**
 * Creates a deep (with limited depth) copy of a given object.
 * This function has some intentional limitations compared to other (deep-)copy
 * functions like `angular.copy` or `_.cloneDeep`.
 *  1. The depth of the copy is limited. Nested object structures that are
 *    deeper than `depth` param are moved to the new object by reference,
 *    without creatign new objects from them. This is mainly to prevent
 *    circular references from crashing the whole thing.
 *  2. Property "$$hashkey" is ignored.
 *  3. Functions in anywhere in the data except in prototype results in
 *    FAILED copy. Functions just can't be "copied" without running into
 *    problems with possibly bad local references etc. This function is
 *    meant to only copy stateful data and moving functions with the data
 *    would just cause too much problems.
 *  4. Scope objects, the window object, WeakMaps and any object marked
 *    with Symbol("ng-hot-reload/injected") also causes the copy to fail.
 *
 * @param {Object} $rootScope
 * @param {Object} obj Object to copy
 * @param {number=} [depth=5] How deep to go in nested structures
 * @return {Result} Successful or failed result of the copy
