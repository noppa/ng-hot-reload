# ng-hot-reload-core

This is the **core** package of [ng-hot-reload](https://github.com/noppa/ng-hot-reload) monorepo.  
It contains the basework for packages [ng-hot-reload-loader](https://github.com/noppa/ng-hot-reload/tree/master/packages/loader) and [ng-hot-reload-standalone](https://github.com/noppa/ng-hot-reload/tree/master/packages/standalone) to build upon.  
If you are adding hot reloading to your own project, you should probably use one of those instead.
