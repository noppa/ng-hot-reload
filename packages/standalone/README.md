# ng-hot-reload-standalone

This is the **standalone** package for [ng-hot-reload](https://github.com/noppa/ng-hot-reload) monorepo.  
It provides methods to start a standalone WebSocket server and send updates to the client. This package integrates quite nicely with [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) but it should also be possible to use it with pretty much any other build tool that is able to watch and react to file changes if you are willing to put some effort into gluing the pieces together.
